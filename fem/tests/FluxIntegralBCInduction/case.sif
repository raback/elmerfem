! Solves a axially symmetric magnetodynamics equation such that the net
! surface current generated on the surface of the conducting piece vanishes.
! This involves sort of Robin BC where the "external potential" is unknown and
! is found such that the net integral of the surface currents vanish.
!
! This test case was done in collaboration with Roland Ernst in 2023
! and saved to a test case later.
