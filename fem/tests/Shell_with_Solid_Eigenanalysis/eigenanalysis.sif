!---------------------------------------------------------
! A test case for assembling 3D solid and 2D shell 
! equations into a single linear system so that the eigenanalysis 
! of the coupled equations can be performed.
!
! This is a cylindrical shell problem with bending-dominated 
! asymptotic behaviour. Here the boundary layer adjacent to an edge 
! is modelled in 3D and the 2D shell model is used elsewhere. 
! The results of this simulation should be compared with those of 
! the 2D shell model
! 
!        ../tests/Shell_BenchmarkCase2_Quad/eigenanalysis.sif
!
! The eigenmodes computed with the different strategies
! appear to be in good agreement. Note that only symmetric modes
! are sought here.
!
! For static analysis of the coupled equations see also the tests 
!
!       ../tests/Shell_with_Solid_BenchmarkCase1/case.sif
!       ../tests/Shell_with_Solid_BenchmarkCase2/case.sif

! Define the thickness of the shell as a MATC variable:
