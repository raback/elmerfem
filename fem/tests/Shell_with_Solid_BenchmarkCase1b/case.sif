!---------------------------------------------------------
! A verification case for assembling 3D solid and 2D shell 
! equations into a single linear system so that the coupled 
! equations can be solved simultaneously.
!
! This is a membrane-dominated benchmark problem described in 
! Pitk√§ranta et al. Shell deformation states and the finite element 
! method: a benchmark study of cylindrical shells. Here the boundary
! layer adjacent to the clamped edge is modelled in 3D and
! the 2D shell model is used elsewhere. For a model using 
! the shell equations only see the test 
!
!       ../tests/Shell_BenchmarkCase1_Quad
!
! The coupling conditions are enforced quite near the clamped 
! edge where the boundary layer is still strong in order to
! test that the effects of bending and transverse shear deformation 
! are handled correctly by the interface conditions.
!
! The results of the coupled simulation have been verified
! against using pure shell equations and pure 3D elasticity
! equations.

! The author of the original version of test: Mika Malinen

!------------------------------------------------------------
! This test case is different from the reference case only in that
! automated settings are used. Also LUA used instead of MATC. 
! Also complements are used in VTU output.
! Modifications: P.R. 17.2.2021


! Define the thickness of the shell as a LUA variable:
#t = 5.0e-2
